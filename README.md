# Oneui 7 WALLPAPER ON AOD Patch for croms (Magisk module)
A universal Magisk module for One UI 7 devices that enables AOD fullscreen wallpapers by patching /system/etc/floating_feature.xml systemlessly. Only the AOD line is changed, preserving all other device-specific settings.
Disclaimer i am NOT repsonsible for any bricked devices this is just a small project made by me for my own use and i decided to make it public and open source for anyone to use!!!!

Installation/requirments:

Requirements:
Device: Any Samsung device running One UI 7 / Android 12+
The module is built for the One UI 7 XML structure.
Other Android versions or older One UI may not work.
Root: The device must be rooted via Magisk
Only Magisk supports systemless overlays required by the module.
Magisk Version: Magisk v29+ recommended
Tested on Magisk 29.0 (or newer).
Older versions may not run post-fs-data.sh or service.sh correctly.
Writable Module Path: The module requires /data/adb/modules/ to be writable
Standard on Magisk installations.
Existing XML: /system/etc/floating_feature.xml must exist
The module copies this file and only modifies the AOD line.
Devices with missing or heavily modified XML may not work.
SELinux: Must be enforcing or permissive
The module uses a bind mount to overlay the patched XML.
No Conflicting Modules:
Other Magisk modules that modify floating_feature.xml can cause conflicts.
